# Tim's kohonen submission

This project contains my solution to the kohonen coding challenge.

Based on the codebase received in kohonen.png, I added 5 meaningful changes.

1. Converted the code from procedural to object-oriented style
2. Improved readability, applying meaningful comments and variable names
3. Used broadcasting to speed up the weight update process
4. Added a Super class for extendability and reusability
5. Added robust error handling

Future improvements
1. Thorough unit testing to catch edge cases
2. API framework like Flask to host web application 
3. Docker file to containerise code

## To run
Built using python 3.13
